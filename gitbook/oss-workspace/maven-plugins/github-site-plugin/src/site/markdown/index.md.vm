Github-Site-Plugin
===================

The _github site plugin_ let you upload Maven Site to Github Pages. By pushing the site generated by Maven to your
Git repository, it allows you to always have an up to date configuration benefiting from the git traceability.

The plugin commits files generated and updates a specific branch reference in a GitHub repository. This  plugin can
be used to deploy a Maven site to a `gh-pages` branch so that it can be served statically as a GitHub Project Page.

The plugin has a [site](site-mojo.html) goal and is configured with a goal prefix of `ghSite. To use the plugin,
read the [quickstart](quickstart.html) guide.

The plugin is built on top of [API v3](http://developer.github.com/) through the
[GitHub Java library](https://github.com/eclipse/egit-github/tree/master/org.eclipse.egit.github.core).

Released builds are available from [Maven Central](http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Ccom.github.github).
